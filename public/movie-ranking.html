<h1>The Best Movies According to Thierson</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The good, the bad, and the ugly</h3>
<p>This has been my favourite movie so far. I love the fact that they were able to put together humour, war, and more. The lyric of the movie is so popular and I love it!</p>

    Tuco: "There are two kinds of spurs...<br />
    Those that come in by the door,<br />
    Those that come in by the windows."<br />

<h3>24 hours chrono</h3>
<p>This is one of the most popular american series out there. The movie is all about terrorism: here, Jack Bauer simulates all the threats/attacks the USA could face.</p>
<h3>Dragon Ball Z</h3>
<p>This is probably the best cartoon of all the times. The best for kids to learn about heroes and science.</p>
