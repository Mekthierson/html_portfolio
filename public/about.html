<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm Thierry Mekontso, was born in Cameroon (in central Africa) IN 1990.</p>

<p>I started school in the year 1996 in Cameroon, where I earned my high school diploma in 2008 (at Mbouda Rural Government High School); then my bachelor degree in 2013. 
  The same year, I was certified high school mathematics teacher, and started teaching mathematics at Ndogpassi Governement High School.</p>

<p>I stopped my career as teacher in 2019, date I traveled to United States of America with my family. We have 3 wonderful kids today, Aerion, Longan, and Ryan.</p>
<p>I'm now an IT student learning in the information security field. Recently, I decided to add more spices to my skills, and that is how I started coding: I can say I'm a FULL STACK ENGINEER! Coding therefore become something I enjoy a lot.</p>
<p>I will ever say thank you to everyone who contribute to this long path, from 1996 until now; especially Angela Yup who made the beast WEB DEVELOPER I am now. Thank you so much!</p>
